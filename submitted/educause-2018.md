### Session Title
Max Words: 10

Sustainable Innovation + Faculty Choice + Student-Centered Design = NGDLE

### Session Overview
Max Words: 50 In fewer than 50 words, state what you will cover during your session. If accepted, this abstract will appear in the program. Please be concise, accurate, and clear.

Hear how teams at Penn State, Duke, and Indiana University, institutions sharing decentralized academic and IT cultures, are building their learning technology ecosystems. Fueled by open source technology and standards, they are embracing user desires by allowing pedagogy and personalization to inform and shape technology selection in sustainably implemented ecosystems.

### Keywords
1 to 5 keyword(s) which are most applicable to your session content.

* Keyword 1 - Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE)
* Keyword 2 - User Experience (UX) Design
* Keyword 3 - Web Components
* Keyword 4 - App Store
* Keyword 5 - Open Source


### Session Description
Max Words: 300 Briefly state the importance, relevance, value, and/or interest to higher education IT.
We all have faculty who decide to use new and/or unsupported learning technologies. Despite the lack of IT support, it may be the best choice for their particular course content and pedagogy. Students, however, are often overwhelmed by the disparate technology tools they must use and manage. In any given semester, students might have four or more different courses where each faculty member has introduced a different platform or has implemented some of the same tools differently.  IT staff have yet another perspective - while they may embrace innovation, they are challenged by the work needed to support the existing and official solutions their organizations use, and it becomes difficult to scale the evaluation and integration of new and emerging tools while ensuring data security, FERPA compliance, and accessibility.

How do we embrace new solutions but do so in a secure, FERPA compliant, and accessible way without overwhelming IT staffs or students? How can IT embrace faculty choice while offering other solutions at the department, school, and university level? 

Hear how teams at Penn State, Duke, and Indiana University - institutions sharing decentralized academic and IT cultures - are working on building their next generation digital learning environments (NGDLEs). Fueled by open source technology and standards, they are embracing user desires by allowing pedagogy and personalization to inform and shape technology selection in sustainably implemented ecosystems.
 
In this session, you'll explore some critical elements for the success of similar initiatives: 
* embrace your university culture and build the right solution for it
* integrate lean methodology in user experience design and development
* develop ecosystem-level management of technologies, not just service level
* open technologies: webcomponents, REST, Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), Grouper

### Session Track
**Exploring Innovation in Teaching and Learning**

How do institutional IT practices enable and empower the core academic mission of teaching, learning, research, and scholarship? These practices include instructional design, digital learning, learning space design, research computing, online and blended learning, accessibility and universal design, and mobile learning, as well as support for libraries, pedagogical research and scholarship.

Other track options

* Creating a Culture of Data-Informed Decision Making
* Leading and Partnering Across the Institution
* Evolving Infrastructure and Enterprise IT
* Managing and Reducing Information Technology Risk
* Transforming the Student Experience

### Session Outcomes
Max Words: 50 Your three session outcomes must clearly articulate what attendees will know or be able to do as a result of participating in the session. We encourage you to take some care in crafting these as these are important in the proposal evaluations. Outcomes must start with an action verb (i.e - understand, describe, identify, explain, etc.). Use the following format:

1. Explain differing interpretations of NGDLE and the role campus academic and IT culture plays in defining and realizing NGDLE.
2. Understand how NGDLE can enable choice at the university, school, and faculty levels while providing better user experiences for students.
3. Describe strategies for enabling sustainable innovation at scale.


### Session Participant Engagement Strategies
Max Words: 300 Briefly describe the specific activities you will use to support active participation. Accepted proposals must include engaging content delivery and participant interaction. Presenters are encouraged to move beyond static PowerPoint slides, avoid "talking heads" to more interactive discussion and innovative ways for participants to learn from one another and contribute shared knowledge.

This session will be discussing NGDLE from two different sides of the relationship. Duke sees a sea of options and is envisioning how we bring it all together for students in a single interface for locating, a map of sorts. Penn State has developed technology solutions and user experience considerations for helping bridge this in real-world courses that are utilizing its NGDLE.

Penn State is developing a powerful, decentralized authoring solution known as HAX which helps make our vision of NGDLE possible. This tool is open source and publicly available, and we will encourage participants to play with the technology during the session and envision what kinds of course experiences they could build if this solution were part of their current technology landscape. 

The last 20 minutes of the session will be discussion-based. We will lead a discussion where attendees can share how they are interpreting and applying NGDLE concepts at their schools and what local contexts are most important for accomplishing NGDLE projects. We will then see how these schools could have their learner experiences enhanced with the tools and strategies presented throughout.

Q&A on our projects will be accepted, but we hope to steer the conversation towards the similarities and differences between schools' interpretations and applications of NGDLE concepts as well as the relationships and partnerships needed to bring NGDLE into practice at a university.

### Diversity and Inclusion Content
Max Words: 100 EDUCAUSE values diversity in perspective, opinion and representation. Our program committee strives to develop a program that represents our diverse community. How does your proposal reflect or address diversity and inclusion?

We use, create, and share open source, free, and universal design. These pillars are core to our groups and allow more people to benefit from our work and participate.

What we are trying to build allows users to choose the tech that works for their brain, needs, classroom, students, content to be learned. We want everyone to be able to get the information they need, when they need it, how they need it. That is inclusive technology for learning.


### Lead Presenter Qualifications
Max Words: 100 Provide a brief bio for the lead presenter covering the scope of professional responsibilities, expertise on the topic, and previous experience presenting or facilitating sessions in the selected conference format.
